I am a self instructed developer, and full time teacher @lecolededesign. 

I work in the artistic field of computer science : I love procedural generation of graphics and audio, I love to play with data representation, physical simulation and music.

Most of my work is published on github and my github.io website will help you find most of the ressources I wrote and projects I made.

Working with MGSX we did some awesome projects I couldn't have lifted off all by myself, check them out :

  * [PPP](http://ppp.mgsx.net) : A framework helping to create android apps from pure-data patches and connect them with a wifi sharable clock.
  * [rainstick](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=net.mgsx.rainstick) : A rainstick app for android

I mainly work with PureData, Processing and P5js.
