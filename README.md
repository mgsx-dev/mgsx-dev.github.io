# Install and Run locally

* install NodeJS (required by jekyll to have a javascript runtime for coffee script) : `sudo apt-get install nodejs npm`
* follow [Github instructions](https://help.github.com/articles/setting-up-your-github-pages-site-locally-with-jekyll/) to have ruby and bundler installed
* install dependencies : `bundle install`
* run jekyll : `bundle exec jekyll serve --watch`
* open your favorite brwoser at http://127.0.0.1:4000/

Note : It's advised to keep your jekyll version up-to-date so `bundle update` before running.
