A small game made during the [Ludum Dare 42 game jam](https://ldjam.com/events/ludum-dare/42) 11st-12nd August 2018.

Game jam rules was "compo" competition : made by one developer (game and assets) in 48 hours.

Game jam theme was **"Running out of space"**.

The idea was to mix a platformer with a puzzle game like tetris : player only controls the blocks not the hero.
