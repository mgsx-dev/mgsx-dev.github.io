This tutorial explain how to deal with platform specific code.

The setup :

* you have a LibGDX game project
* you need to have different implementation regarding to platforms : not same code for android, desktop, html, ...etc.

How to do :

* first define an platform agnostic interface for your "service", let's call it MyGameService
* then create a base implementation where you can centralize common code for implementations, called MyGameServiceBase (make it abstract)
* then create a default implemntation extending the base and design for platforms doesn't support this service : MyGameServiceDefault
* then create a factory for it : MyGameServiceFactory containing a static variable
* now for each platforms that doesn't support the service :
    * just set the instance MyGameServiceFactory.instance = new MyGameServiceDefault();
* for each platform that support the service : 
    * create an implementation (eg. MyGameServiceAndroid, MyGameServiceDesktop, MyGameServiceWeb)
    * instanciate in launcher (eg. in android launcher : MyGameServiceFactory.instance = new MyGameServiceAndroid())

Now in your platform independant code (core module) you can easily call MyGameServiceFactory.instance.doThisOrThat()

TODO example of a file selector : 
* desktop : Applet
* web : HTML5 File API
* android : Intent ?
* iOS : not supported ...
* core : chooseFile(filter)
